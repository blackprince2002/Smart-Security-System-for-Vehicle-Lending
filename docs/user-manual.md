# User Manual

## Project Guidelines
During the development of the Safety Monitoring System and Black Box for Lending Vehicles, comprehensive testing is a critical step to ensure the system's reliability and functionality. Testing involves validating the system's response across various scenarios, identifying any potential issues, and refining the system based on the results. Furthermore, as technology advances and user feedback is received, ongoing evaluation and improvement are essential to maintain the system's efficacy and adapt to changing requirements.
- Scenario-based Testing: The system must be tested under different conditions to ensure that each component functions as intended and responds appropriately to varying inputs.
- Alcohol Sensor Test: Simulate diverse alcohol concentrations using controlled sources and confirm whether the system effectively triggers alarms and notifications at predetermined thresholds.
- Flame Sensor Test: Introduce controlled flames to the sensor and validate whether the system can accurately detect fires, activate alarms, and notify users accordingly.
- Rain Sensor Test: Simulate rain using controlled water droplets to ensure the wipers activate and the vehicle's speed adjusts correctly.
- Temperature Sensor Test: Vary the temperature to ensure accurate readings and verify that the system responds adequately to extreme temperature conditions.
- Fingerprint Sensor Test: Enrol authorized users' fingerprints and validate that only authorized individuals can access the vehicle.
- GSM Module Test: Send test SMS alerts to confirm that the module can communicate with cellular networks, delivering alerts to designated phone numbers.
- OLED Display Test: Ensure that the touch screen display accurately presents sensor data and that the interface responds appropriately to user inputs.
- Integration Validation: It is crucial to test the interaction between different components of the system to ensure seamless communication and functionality.
- Sensor Integration: Verify that the microcontroller correctly retrieves data from all sensors and responds adequately.
- GSM and SMS Integration: Confirm that the microcontroller can initiate the GSM module to send SMS alerts with accurate content and recipient numbers.
- Touch Display and User Interface: Test user interactions on the touch screen display and confirm that displayed information updates in real-time.
